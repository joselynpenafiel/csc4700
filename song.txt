I was lying
In the grass
The sun was shining
Covered by
Hanging vines
And it was quiet

It was clear
And it was calm
And in the silence
Feeling time
As it went by
And disappeared

No more falling out
It's a phantom limb
Never been without
Always been within

In the night I will try to come and find it
Itâ€™s a fire we all try to keep alive
