What is your favorite movie?
Midsommar

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
Ecuador / Galapagos Islands

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
My super power would be to survive in water / be able to breathe under water. For a long time I've been afraid of deep sea creatures or the unknown in the deep oceans. I want to face my fears and really know what is down there.
